# VSCode-CSP-Support

This is an extension of Visual Studio Code to support syntax highlighting for CSPm (machine-readable CSP). 

Invented and developed by C. A. R. Hoare, CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) is a process algebra used to model and study concurrent systems. The University of Oxford has developed a piece of software, called FDR, which assists with modelling and visualization of concurrent systems described in CSP. CSPm is a programming language to write scipts that are read in by FDR. The documentation for CSPm and FDR is available [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/manual/).
