# VSCode-CSP-Support

This is an extension of Visual Studio Code to support syntax highlighting for CSP<sub>M<\sub> (machine-readable CSP). 

Invented and developed by C. A. R. Hoare, CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) is a process algebra used to model and study concurrent systems. The University of Oxford has developed a piece of software, called FDR, which assists with modelling and visualization of concurrent systems described in CSP.

Users write scripts containing definitions of processes and assertions to be verified. FDR then reads in these scripts. The users can click buttons to have the program work out the validity of the given assertions. CSP<sub>M<\sub> is a programming language to write scripts that are read in by FDR. The documentation for CSP<sub>M<\sub> and FDR is available [here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/fdr/manual/).
